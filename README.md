# CS3480 - Software Language Engineering, MIDI Programming Language

For my CS3480 - Software Language Engineering module, we were tasked with using the [ART](https://github.com/AJohnstone2007/ART) (Ambiguity Retained Translation) toolkit to assist in developing the syntax for a partiular programming language fitting one of three themes. The theme I had chosen in this context was to develop a Music Programming Language.

This was an individual project and took place throughout the duration of the term. The language is written using ART syntax, and is converted to corresponding Java code via the included `art.jar` file, before being executed. A plugin file has been provided to facilitate additional features that cannot be executed directly in ART syntax. 

There are two different forms of syntax available. Reduction follows the idea of programs being consistently rewritten until a base instruction in order to carry out a particular task, while Attribute has corresponding Java code available to help faciliate execution.

This was a very fun and unique project overall - and I am very grateful for the support which I have received from my lecturer on this.
